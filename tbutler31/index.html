            A Computer Science major with a deep seated passion for all things computer related. From software all the
            way down to the hardware itself. I pride myself on how quickly I can learn and put ideas into practice. My
            origins in this interest spans all the way back to middle school when I saved up for and bought my first
            laptop. A cheap HP laptop, but it was one of the first things I ever bought for myself. Since then I've
            developed a love for technology as a whole.

            I have a strong foundation in C++, Java, and C# languages. Much of my effort has been spent learning about
            algorithms and building unique solutions based on that knowledge. AI has been another focus of mine as a
            result. Also in my repetoire is a bit of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python. I can quickly pick up any new
            language too.

            With my free time I will often pick from a number of activities. Sometimes I like to pick up a guitar or
            bass and play around with it for a few hours. I've spent time dabbling lightly in digital art. So much
            respect for the people that can manage it because it's hard. Of course, much of my free time is spent
            playing video games with a focus on story heavy experiences. Finally, on occasion I like to read a good
            fantasy novel or two.
